# Overview

My solutions written in [Golang](http://golang.org) for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).
Note that this code is **hacky, not polished or refactored in any way** and its sole purpose it to solve the puzzles.
After I have the correct solution, I leave the source code as it is, ... to clean it up ... someday ;-).
